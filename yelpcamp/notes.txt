APP is divided into various versions (since there are various sections). 
Once a section is completed, I put it in a separate branch - so as to store the development in a section by section basis (& comeback to it if need be it).

/////////  SECTION 1 - Basics /////////////////////

1.1 INITIAL ROUTES
    * Add Landing page
    * Add Campgrounds page that lists all campgrounds
    * Each campground  in the campgrounds.ejs has: a) Name b) Image

1.2 SETUP THE PARTIALS 

1.3 FEATURE TO ADD NEW CAMPGROUNDS
    * Setup POST Request routes.
    * REST API conventions, if you have a page xyz where you are seeing abc (using GET), if you want to add more abc, you'd have setup a POST request to the same xyz. Also, you need to create a separate page like xyz/new where you put up a form to create a new istance of abc. 

1.4 STYLING THE CAMPGROUNDS PAGE
    * Add a jumbotron
    * Basic grid system for each campground (including `display: flex; flex-wrap; wrap;` to style attribute to make grid more flexible).
    * Add a `text-center` bootstrap class to center the text for each campground Image
    * NOTE: Above classes flex-wrap, flex, tex center are part of bootstrap not html

1.5 STYLING(cont'd): Basic Navbar & Form design
    
///////////  SECTION 2 - Data Persistence ///////////////////

2.1 ADDING & CONFIGURING MONGODB, MONGOOSE
    * Connect Mongoose to the app
    * Create basic Schema for the campground (Just image, name)
    * Create & store in db whenever a campground is added via "/campgrounds/new" in POST "/campgrounds" route.
